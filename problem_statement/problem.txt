Task 1 - Setup Virtual Networks

Subtask 1. Create Virtual Network

1. Create virtual network named EastUS Vnet for hosting web servers (w1, w2) and associate resources in the East us region
2. Create another virtual network named EastUS2 VNet for hosting the WS11 server in the East US 2 region.

Subtask  2. Vnet to Vnet peering

1. Establish a VNet-to-VNet Peering between EastUS VNet and EastUS2 VNet to allow communication between internal IP addresses.
2. Ensure traffic encryption during transit.

-----------------------------

Task 2 - Deploy Virtual Machines

Subtask 1. Web Servers in EastUS

1. Deploy two virtual machines, w1 and w2, in the EastUS VNet.
2. Place both VMs in a single availability set to ensure 99.95% availability.
3. Configure a Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic between w1 and w2.
4. Set up Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway) to allow web administrators to connect without standard RDP clients.

Subtask  2. WS11 Server in EastUS2

1. Deploy a virtual machine named WS11 in the EastUS2 VNet.
2. Restrict outbound traffic on WS11 to block access to social media sites using Azure Firewall rules.

-----------------------------

Task 3 - Implement Secure Connectivity

Subtask 1. Site-to-Site VPN Gateway or Azure Private Link
1. Configure either a Site-to-Site VPN Gateway or Azure Private Link for secure communication between resources in EastUS VNet and EastUS2 VNet.

Subtask 2. Network Security Groups (NSGs)
1. Use Network Security Groups (NSGs) to restrict unauthorised access to resources within the virtual networks.

-----------------------------

Task 4 - Setup Storage Solutions

Subtask 1. EastUS Resources:

1. Configure Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS) to ensure data resiliency in case of Azure data center failure.
2. Set up secure access to storage using:
3. Shared Access Signatures (SAS).
4. Access Keys.
5. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
6. Provide application access URLs and keys as part of the setup.

Subtask 2. EastUS2 Resources (WS11):

1. Configure Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS) to ensure high resiliency even during multiple data center failures.
2. Map the storage to the S: drive on the WS11 server using Azure File Share or Blob Storage with secure credentials.

-----------------------------

Guidelines

Guidelines 1 -->  ARM Templates

Provide a JSON file containing the resource definitions for deploying the entire infrastructure.
Requirements:

Define the following resources:

Virtual Networks (EastUS VNet, EastUS2 VNet) and their peering connections.
Virtual Machines (w1, w2, WS11) and their configurations.
Availability Set for the web servers (w1, w2).
Load Balancer for distributing traffic to the web servers.
Azure Firewall with rules to restrict outbound traffic for WS11.
Storage accounts for EastUS (ZRS) and EastUS2 (GRS) resources.

Guidelines 2 -->  Visual Diagram

Share an architecture diagram that displays all components of the solution. 

Must Include:
VNets and their peering connections.
Virtual machines, availability sets, and load balancers.
Azure Firewall and NSGs.
Storage configurations and secure access mechanisms.
